            <p>
            We met in Christian’s apartment in Brooklyn.I had just returned from India and was staying with my cousin Grayce while looking for an apartment. One day, after looking at different apartments, I needed the keys to go back home. I reached out to Grayce who asked me to meet her in Brooklyn because she was recording a dance video with Peter (Christian’s roommate). When I got there Christian was on the couch watching TV.  3 years of friendship later, we started dating and you know the rest.
